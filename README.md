# WashU-Athletics-Demographics
Study on the demographics of WashU Student-Athletes

### Technologies
- React + TailwindCSS
- Typescript
- Python
- Flask
- Postgres
- Maps: MapBox + Open Street Map
- DeepFace

### Tasks
- ✅ Add lat/long coordinates to athlete column in athletes (Mapbox Search for Geocoding)
- ✅  Create REST endpoint for accessing all athletes `localhost:5000/athletes`
- ✅ Create React APP
- ✅  Import map into react app: Open Street Map (leaflet)
- ✅ Add markers for athlete locations
- ✅ UI Improvements: Tailwind CSS, Different Color Markers for different teams


### Notes
- Originally tried creating the front end using NextJS (ended up running into bugs with React Leaflet -> not created with considerations for server side rendering)
- Switched to Create-react-app as a result

### Resources

- Future Iterations: 
    - CubeJS (full stack for building data driven applications)
